# A-Star-algorithm

Algorithm to find the shortest path for a list of nodes, which each node contain a table (matrix). This table consists in 16 positions, one of this positions is null (zero), all of the rest are named with the numbers from 1 to 15. 

The shortest path is the minimal number of movements of pieces to reach the sequence:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0].
A piece can only be changed with the piece [0]

So, if we have the sequence [14,11,3,10,0,6,7,8,9,4,2,12,13,1,15,5], we need to find de minimal number of movements(shortest path) to reach the sequence [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0]
